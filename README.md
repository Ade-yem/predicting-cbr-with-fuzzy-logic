# Predicting CBR of laterite with Fuzzy Logic

The model takes percentage of fiber (fibre), liquid limit (liquid_limit) and
Optimum moisture content (omc) as input and California Bearing
ratio (cbr) as output.

244 Fuzzy rules are created for the model to ensure more accurate prediction
The results of the model are in [Reports folder]("./reports")
